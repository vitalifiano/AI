    <h2 class="highlighter"><i>Topic</i></h2>
    
    
    <p class="box textbox" style="margin: auto;"> The field of technology has become a crucial part of our daily lives and as a result it is a subject to a variety of legal requirements, including those related to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, and liability. While ethical guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence exist. As of 2023, there are no laws or regulations solely dedicated to Artificial Intelligence. In response to this issue, our team has developed a website to propose comprehensive federal laws specifically made for this matter. As Artificial Intelligence gradually becomes more advanced and capable of gathering vast amounts of data, To ensure the safety and responsible use of this source, it is essential to establish appropriate regulations and laws governing its development and implementation. By doing this we are able to mitigate the potential risks and ensure that this technology is used for the betterment of society as a whole. </p>

        <h2 class="highlighter"><i> What is AI?</i></h2>

<br>

<p style="text-align:center; margin:auto;" class="textbox box"> AI is short for Artificial Intelligence. An umbrella term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input. One of the most exciting aspects of AI is the fact that it is able to perform tasks that were once considered to be exclusive to the domain of human creativity. For example, AI can now generate art, music, and even creative writing. Despite the creative expression of AI, it is also being used to solve most of the world's biggest problems. From climate change and the efficient use of energy to healthcare system and transportation. The vast amount of data that is being analyzed is being saved into the membrane of the Artificial Intelligence's brain. As well as the patterns and trends that may not be common knowledge to humans. The system is able to output accurate predictions and more informed decisions. AI is the literal personification of Intelligence itself.</p>

    <h2 class="highlighter"><i>How Does it Work?</i></h2>

<br>

<p style="text-align:center; margin:auto;" class="textbox box"> The SAS Institute states that AI is trained and works "by combining large amounts of data with fast, literative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data." An algorithm able of an approach to continuously improve a concept, design, idea, or product is fed samples of human made examples of the task given to replicate the process and product. Attempting to closely achieve the similarity of the samples given. The networks of an AI is modeled after the brain of a human being, these networks are designed to learn, adapt and predict the processed data that it is given.  This training mechanism is special because once an AI is used to the tasks it is given, it can then be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from speech recognition and language translation to image and video analysis. These tasks would now be able to happen on it's own without needing human input.</p>

<li style="text-align:center; margin-right:2.5vh" class="highlighter">Generalizing Data </li>

 <br>

<p style="margin-right:2.5vh"  class="textbox">Artificial Intelligence can generalize the data, meaning they can comprehend data, which then they can make accurate predictions of the data. </p>

 <br>

<li style="text-align:center; margin-right:2.5vh" class="highlighter">Modifications </li>

 <br>

<p style="margin-right:2.5vh"  class="textbox">Artificial Intelligence has the ability to modify the data that it was given. This is what happens when you ask an AI to rephrase your paragraph or essay.</p>

<br>

<p style="margin-right:2.5vh" class="textbox"> Artificial Intelligence unbalances the future of education, as students use it to their advantage to pass assignments in school. For example, ChatGPT is being used to automatically write essays for lazy students.</p>

<br>

<li style="text-align:center; margin-right:3vh" class="highlighter">Job Loss</li>

<br>

<p style="margin-right:2.5vh" class="textbox"> As Artificial Intelligence improves, the likelihood of Job Loss is bringing fear to the working society. If this were to occur in the future, everyone would be living in poverty.</p>

<br>

<li style="text-align:center; margin-right:3vh" class="highlighter">Limitations of Data</li>

<br>

<p style="margin-right:2.5vh" class="textbox"> Artificial Intelligence is only limited to data that matches similarities with the data you gave it. Meaning that, the AI cannot think outside of the box as humans do.</p>
