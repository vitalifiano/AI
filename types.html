    <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="highlighter"> Narrow AI</h2>

<br>

    <p style="margin-left:auto;" class="textbox box2">
        Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa rely on Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) to function. ANI refers to intelligent systems that are specifically trained or designed to perform particular tasks or solve particular problems, without being programmed to do so explicitly.</p>
        
        <br>
        
    <p style="margin-right:auto;" class="textbox box2">ANI is usually looked down upon due to its "limited knowledge" examples of its capabilities include image recognition systems, simple customer service requests, flagging inappropriate online content, and the aforementioned voice assistants. Modern examples of Narrow AI would be ChatGPT (GPTs) a Chatbot AI that has the ability to naturally have knowledge of every answer to a question and a wide spread of languages.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;" class="highlighter"> General AI</h2>

<br clear="left">

    <p style="margin-left:auto;" class="textbox box2">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), also known as Strong AI, is a theoretical concept that involves a machine's ability to understand and perform a wide range of tasks based on earned experience. It is similar to human intelligence since an AGI system would be capable of reasoning and thinking like a human. An AGI system would be able to learn from its experiences, think abstractly, and solve new problems. Basically, it would possess common sense, something that current AI technology lacks.</p>

    <br>
        
    <p style="margin-right:auto;" class="textbox box2">Developing an AGI system with its own consciousness is still a long way off, but it is the ultimate goal of AI research. Creating an AGI system capable of human-like intelligence and consciousness remains a long-term objective. For example, autonomous vehicles like Tesla. It is focused on AGI because it is given tasks from the human input from the GPS to make it drive to your location using a sensory mechanic to sense vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrians etc.</p>

<br>

    <h2 style="text-align:centerl" class="highlighter"> Super AI </h2>

<br>

    <p style="margin-left:auto;" class="textbox box2"> Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) is a theoretical system that could potentially not only revolutionize humanity but also have the power to destroy it. Although it may sound like something straight out of a science fiction novel, the concept of ASI involves a machine whose intelligence surpasses all forms of human intelligence, outperforming humans in every aspect and function.</p>

    <br>
        
    <p style="margin-right:auto;" class="textbox box2">Further discovery of ASI could possibly lead to the end of the world as it might surpass human control. As a fictional example, the Terminator is a Super AI because it surpassed the knowledge of human capacity which made it almost impossible to control.</p>
